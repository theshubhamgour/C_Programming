*What is pointer?
pointer is a variable that is able to hold address of 
another variable.

NOTE: 
    while working with pointer we need to require two unary
    operator i.e:

    1) &: address of operator
    2) *: value at address of operator

    Syntax: 
            datatype * var_name;

    eg: int a=10, *p(pointer), **q(pointer to pointer);
        p = &a;
        q = &p;

Types of pointer:
 
 1) void pointer
 2) wild pointer
 3) null pointer
 4) dangling pointer
 5) pointer to pointer
 6) function pointer
