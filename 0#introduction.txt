*******Introduction to C*************
 
    *What is C language?
      C is a middle-level procedural oriented programming language  developed by 
"Dennis Ritche" at AT&T's Bell lab in 1972 in USA.

Syntax:

#include<stdio.h>
#include<conio.h>   //optional only in turbo c.
void main(){
    //Statement;
}


#include<stdio.h> -- # is called the preprocessor directive and stdio.h is a 
standard library mostly used for I/O operations, and include links the library with the 
preprocessor.
