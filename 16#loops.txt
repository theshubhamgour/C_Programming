**loops**

*What is loop?
Loop is used to repeat a block of code until the given condition is true.

*Types:

1. while loop 
2. do-while loop
3. for loop
4. Nested loop (A loop inside a loop is called a Nested loop)


*While loop:
 
  Syntax: 
            while(condition){
                Statement;
            }


*do-while loop: 

  Syntax:
            do{
                Statement;
            }while(condition);


*for loop: 

   Syntax:
            for(intitalization;condition;increment/decrement){
                Statement;;
            }



*Nested loop:
  Syntax:
            for(intitalization;cond];increment/decrement)
            {

                for(intitalization;cond];increment/decrement)
                {
                    
                }
            }

***Jumping Statement: 

*break (terminate from a particular block)
*continue (Skip)
*exit (exit from program)
*goto (we can do repeated task using goto just like loops)
*return (used for returning a value) //we will discuss it later in the video
