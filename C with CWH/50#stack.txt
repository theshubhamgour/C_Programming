  * is Dynamic memory?
            Dynamic memory allocation is the process of allocation of memory space at the run time. 
            We use the concept of dynamic memory allocation to reduce the wastage of memory, 
            and it is the optimal way of memory allocation. 

  *Memory Allocation in C:
            Memory allocation in C can be divided into four segments. 

  *Code: 
            Code composes of all the text segment of our program. 

  *Variables: 
            By variables, we mean both global and static variables. Global variables can be used anywhere in the program,
            while static has its limitations inside the function. The variable segment is further divided into 
            two segments, depending on the data they can store.

  *Data segment: stores initialized data i.e., data whose value is already given.
For example:

            int i = 0;
            bss segment: stores uninitialized data i.e., data whose variable is initialized only.
            For example:

int i = 0;


* Stack:(Last in first out)
The stack is a LIFO data structure. It's size increases when the program moves forward.


*Stack Overflow:
When a stack gets exhausted due to bad programming skills or some logical error, \
the phenomenon is known as Stack Overflow.

* Heap:
Heap is a tree-based data structure. Itâ€™s size increases when we allocate memory dynamically. 
To use the heap data structure, we have to create a pointer in our main function that will point
 to some memory block in a heap. The disadvantage of using heap is that the memory will not get 
 freed automatically when the pointer gets overwritten.
