**Recursive Functions :
Recursive functions or Recursion is a process when a function
 calls a copy of itself to work on smaller problems.

Recursion is the process in which a function calls itself directly or indirectly. 
And the corresponding function or function which calls itself is called as recursive function.


    * This makes life of programmer easy by dividing complex problem into simple or easier problems.
    * Any function which calls itself is called recursive function.
    * A termination condition is imposed on such functions to stop them executing copies of themselves forever or infinitely.
    * Any problem which can be solved recursively can also be solved iteratively.
    * Recursions are used to solve tower of Hanoi, Fibonacci series, factorial finding etc.

 

*Base condition in recursion :
The case at which the function doesnâ€™t recur is called the base case.

*Recursive Case :
The instances where the function keeps calling itself to perform a subtask
 i.e. solving problem by dividing it in small parts, is called the recursive case.
