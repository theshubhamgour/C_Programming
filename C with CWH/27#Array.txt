**Arrays :
 
An array is a collection of data items of the same
data type. And it is also known as subscript variable.

  *Items are stored at contiguous memory locations in Arrays.

  *It can also store the collection of derived data 
    types such as pointers, structures etc.

  *The C Language places no limits on the number of dimensions in 
    an array i.e. we can create any no. of dimension array
     E.g. 2d array, 3d array etc.


*Why do we need Arrays ?

Code that use arrays for managing large no. of 
same type variables is more organized and readable.
Arrays allow us to create many variables by just a single line.
It means there is no need to create or specify each and every variable.

Advantage of Arrays :
It is used to represent multiple data items of same type by using only single name.
Accessing an item in a given array is very fast.

Properties of Array :
                     * Data in an array is stored in contiguous memory locations in RAM.
                     * Each element of an array is of same size i.e. their data types are 
                     * same so memory consumed by each is also same.
                     * Any element of the array with given index can be accessed very 
                     * quickly by using its address which can be calculated using the base address and the index.
