Pointer :

         *  Pointer is a variable that contains address of another variable. 
         *  It means it is a variable but this variable contains address or 
                memory address of any other variable.
         *  It can be of type int, char, array, function, or any other pointer.
                Its size depends on architecture.
         *  Pointers in C Language can be declared using *(asterisk symbol).

*Some of the operators which we use with Pointers :

Address of Operator (&) :
·      It is a unary operator.

·      Operand must be the name of the variable.

·      & operator gives address no. of variable.

·      & is also known as “Referencing Operator”.

 

Indirection Operator :
·      * is indirection operator.

·      It is also known as “Dereferencing Operator”.

·      It is a unary operator.

·      It takes address as an argument.

·      * returns the content/container whose address is it’s argument. 

 
 
*Null Pointer : 
                  
                 * A pointer that is not assigned any value but NULL is known as NULL pointer.
                 * In computer programming NULL pointer is a pointer that does not point to any object, variable or function.
                 * We can use it to initialize a pointer variable when that pointer variable isn’t assigned any valid memory address yet.
                            int *ptr = NULL;

Uses of Pointers:
·      Dynamic Memory Allocation

·      Arrays, Functions and Structures

·      Return multiple values from a function

·      Pointer reduces the code and improves the performance
