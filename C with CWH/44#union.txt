**What are the similarities between Structure and Union??
            Structure and union are user-defined data types used to store data of different types.
            The members of structure and union can be objects of any type, including other structures and unions or arrays.
            A union or a structure can be passed by value to functions and returned by value by functions.
            ‘.’ operator is used for accessing union and structure members.



*What are the differences between Structure and Union
        * The keyword union is used to define a union and a keyword struct is used to define the structure
        * Each member within a structure is assigned a unique storage area of location whereas memory allocated is shared by individual members of the union.
        * Individual members can be accessed at a time in structure whereas only one member can be accessed at a time in union
        * Altering the value of the member will not affect other members of the structure, whereas altering the value of any member will affect other member's values.
        * Several members of a structure can be initialized at once, whereas only one member can be initialized in union



***IN nutshell, union will take less space than structure****


eg:           
                           struct books
                            {
                                int pages;
                                float price;
                                char title[20];     //here the size of struct is: int+float+char =13
                            }b1

    
    whereas,


                                 union books
                                {
                                    int pages;
                                    float price; 
                                    char title[20];   //here the size of union wi;; be same as that of float(since float is the largest datatype here)
                                }b1
