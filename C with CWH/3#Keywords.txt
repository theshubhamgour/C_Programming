*Basic Syntax Of a C Program:
            A C program is made up of different tokens combined together.
            These tokens include:
                * Keywords
                * Identifiers
                * Constants
                * String Literal
                * Symbols
*Keywords:
        Keywords are reserved words that can not be used elsewhere in the program
        for naming a variable or function, instead they have a specific function 
        or tasks and they are solely used for that.


*Note there are 32 Keywords.

            int      | char     | float   |  double
            return   | register | auto    |  void
            continue | break    | goto    |  extern
            do       | switch   | case    |  while
            else     | if       | const   |  for
            enum     | signed   | unsigned|  static
            union    | struct   | short   |  sizeof 
            typeof   | volatile | default |  long

*Identifiers:
        Identifiers are names given to variables or functions in order to differentiate 
        them from one another. eg:int a;

    'Note: C is a case sensitive language so an identifier containing a capital letter
    and another one containing a small letter at the same place will be different.
    For example the three words: Code, code and cOde can be used as three different 
    identifiers.'

*Constant:
        The only difference between constant and variable is that a 
        constantâ€™s value never changes. 

*Symbol:
        Symbols are special characters reserved to perform certain actions. They are used to notify the compiler so they can perform specific tasks on the given data. 
        for eg: & is being used as a address of symbol.
