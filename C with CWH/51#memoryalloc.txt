For the allocation of memory using the heap, we have four functions:

                                                                       * Malloc
                                                                       * Calloc 
                                                                       * Realloc 
                                                                       * Free

*malloc():
            malloc stands for memory allocation. As can be guessed by its name, it requests memory 
            from the heap and returns a pointer to the memory                                                                       

*calloc():
            calloc stands for contiguous allocation. It also requests memory from the heap and returns a pointer 
            to the memory and has the same functionality as malloc().

*realloc():
            realloc stands for reallocation. It is used in cases where the dynamic memory is insufficient or wants to increase the 
            already allocated memory to store more data. Its syntax is simple as we just have to overwrite the memory already 
            allocated as a parameter in the function while providing the data related to the pointer. 

*free():
            We have to free up the allocated memory space manually as there is no automatic procedure for that. 
            So free is used to free up the space occupied by the allocated memory.
