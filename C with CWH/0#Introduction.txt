*What is C?
            C is one of the fastest programming language as it is close to low-level language
        such as Assembly language. if you are already familiar with programming, then you must 
        know the demand  out there for a C programmer. Because C comes in handy in case of all the 
        applications that require fast processing, such as games, or major parts of different 
        opreating system.

 *Benefits of C:
            C was developed in early 1970’s but it is still in much demand and it doesn’t seem it is
            going anywhere,there are a lot of reasons for that such as:

            * C takes only significant CPU time for interpretation. That is why a lot Python libraries
              such as NumPy, pandas, scikit-learn, etc. are built using C.
            * It is a highly portable language.
            * Data structure and algorithm can be better implemented in C language.
            * C is being used to support other programming languages to enhance their efficiency.

*Scope:
        * Windows, Linux, Mac all are mostly written in C. Linux is written 97% using C.
        * C has also been used widely while creating iOS and Android kernels.
        * MySQL database is written using C.
        * Ruby and Pearl are mostly written using C.
        * Most part of Apache and NGINX is written using C.
        * Embedded Systems are created using C

*Summary:
        C is not a hard language to learn and along with that it stills has a scope 
        in the future. It is a low-level programming language that makes it more
        efficient and swifter. So many devices and applications are build completely 
        or partially using C, so there is a wide range of options related to field you 
        want to get into.

*What Is Coding & C Programming Language?
        If we look at the definition i.e. 
                   “ coding is the ability to write computer programs”. 
        Programming or coding is an act of telling the computer, what to do? 

*History:
        C language was developed by Dennis Ritchie in 1972. At that time, he was 
        working at bell laboratories of AT&T. 

*What is an IDE?
        IDE stands for Integrated development environment. It is nothing more than an enhanced 
        version of a text editor that helps you write more efficient and nicer code. It helps to 
        differentiate different parts of your codes with different colors and notifying you if you 
        are missing some semicolon or bracket at some place by highlighting that area. A lot of IDEs 
        are available such as DEVC++ or Code Blocks but we are going to use VS Code 

*Compiler:
        A compiler is used to run the program of a certain language by converting the code into the language
        that our computer could understand. Without a compiler we can not run our code. Every programming language 
        is required a different compiler for its functioning because the syntax of every language is different from the other.
        There are a lot of compilers available, but we are going to use MinGW for this course because it will fulfill all of our 
        requirements and also it is recommended by Microsoft itself.
