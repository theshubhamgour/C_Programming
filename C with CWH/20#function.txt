**Functions :
             * Functions are used to divide a large C program into smaller pieces.
             * Function can be called multiple or several times to provide reusability and modularity to the C program.
             * Functions are also called as procedure or subroutines.
             * It is a piece of code to accomplish certain operation.


*Now let’s understand in simple terms what function is?
                Function is nothing but a group of code put together and given a name and it can be called anytime 
                without writing the whole code again and again in a program.

*Advantages of Functions :
                   * We can avoid rewriting same logic or code through functions.
                   * We can divide the work among programmers using functions.
                   * We can easily debug or can find bugs in any program using functions.

Function Aspects :
There are 3 aspects of function :-

(1)Declaration : A function is declared to tell the compiler about its existence.

(2)Definition : A function is defined to get some task done. (It means when we define function we write whole code of that function. 
                In this actual implementation of function is done.)

(3)Call : A function is called in order to be used.
 


*Types of Functions :

                        (1)Library Functions – These are pre-defined functions in C Language. 
                                            These are the functions which are included in C header files.

                        (2)User defined Functions – Functions created by programmer to reduce complexity of a program 
                                                    i.e. these are the functions which are created by user or programmer.



**Ways to define a Function :

        There are 4 ways in which we can define any C Function and these are :

                                                                            *Without arguments and without return value.
                                                                            *Without arguments and with return value.
                                                                            *With arguments and without return value.
                                                                            *With arguments and with return value.
