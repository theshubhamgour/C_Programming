Arithmetic operators:
rithmetic operators are used to perform mathematical operations such as addition,
subtraction etc. Few of the simple arithmetic operators are :

     *Operator Description: 
                        + : Addition
                        - : Subtraction
                        * : Multiplication
                        / : Division
                        % : Modulus

*Relational Operators:
                      Relational operators are used for the comparison between two or more numbers. 

     *Operator Description:

                             >  : Greater than

                             <  : Less than

                            >=  : Greater than or equal to

                            <=  : Less than or equal to

                            ==  : Is equal to

                            !=  : Is not equal to

*Logical Operators:
                        There are three logical operators i.e. AND, OR and NOT. They can be used to compare Boolean values but are 
                        mostly used to compare conditions to see whether they are satisfying or not. 

        *Symbol Operator:

                            && :  AND operator

                            || :  OR Operator

                            !  : NOT Operator

*Bitwise Operators:
                    To perform bit level operations, bitwise operators are used. They convert the values we provide to them in binary 
                    format and then compare them to provide us the results.

        *Symbols Operators:

                            &  : Bitwise AND

                            |  : Bitwise OR

                            ^  : Bitwise XOR

                            ~  : Bitwise complement

                           <<  : Shift left

                           >>  : Shift right

*Assignment Operators:
                        Assignment operators are used to assign values. They are going to be used in each and every one of our program.

        *Operator Description:

                                =  : Assigns values from right side operands to left side operand

                                += : It adds the right operand to the left operand and assign the result to the left operand.

                                -= : It subtracts the right operand from the left operand and assigns the result to the left operand.

                                *= : It multiplies the right operand with the left operand and assigns the result to the left operand.

                                /= : It divides the left operand with the right operand and assigns the result to the left operand.
