**What is array?
 Array is a collection of similar type of data items in a 
 contiguos memory location.

 *Why array?
 We don't have to initialise similar kind of variables
 whose value differs but DATAYPE is same.

 NOTE: indexing of Array starts from 0.

   Syntax: 
            DATAYPE array_name[size];
            eg: a[5] = {12,23,2,4,45,56}

            value at index 0: 12
            value at index 1: 23
            value at index 2: 2
            value at index 3: 4
            value at index 4: 45
            value at index 5: 56

*Types of Array:
 1. 1-D Array
 2. 2-D Array
